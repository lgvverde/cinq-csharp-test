# CSharpWebApi
Here is a simple c# test for the candidates.

1. Refactor the current code, using the Solid Principles
2. Implement the following features in the Console project : 
   * Parse the response from the WebAPI to a concrete model
   * Insert the data into the only table of the database
   * Connections to the database should be closed at the end
   * Don't keep all code in the Program.cs file. 
3. Implement the following features in the WebAPI project :
   * Create repositories with a virtual database, using the models as tables.(static classes with lists just holding data)
   * Refactor the PrintersController to use the repositories you just created
4. Write tests for both Console and WebAPI projects, as well as for any projects you might create.
